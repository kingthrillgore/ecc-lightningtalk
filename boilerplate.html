	<h1>Why we encrypt</h1>
	<p><em>Any individual who is not concerned about his freedom commits an act of moral and spiritual suicide. - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</em></p>
</section>

<section class="slide">
	<h2>A decade of psuedo-trust</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We rely on strong Pseudo-Random Number Generators (pRNGs) to provision keys for encryption</li>
		<li>pRNG sources (/dev/random, memory entropy) are considerably unreliable and predictable when compared to true entropy sources</li>
		<li>Theoretically, we could provide possible sequences for the exhaustive task of brute-forcing keys forged via pRNG</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Winning the arms race on pRNG</h2>

<section class="slide">
	<h2>What happens now?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>NIST has a huge PR problem on its hands</li>
		<ul>
			<li>NIST has re-opened the RFCs for additonal feedback on ECC algorithms</li>
			<li>...but they're not accepting anything due to the #shutdown #bullshit #yolo</li>
		</ul>
		<li>RSA Security, a large provider of security solutions, has advised companies to abandon DRBG in its own software</li>
		<li>The press is having a field day with this, as they struggle to keep the NSA in the public consciousness</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
	<h2>What should I do?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Use ECC algorithms that are public and have been subject to intense peer review</li>
		<li>DSCG 142 A is the official algorithm adopted by OpenSSL, GPG, and the OpenBSD Crypto stack</li>
		<li>The OpenBSD Crypto mailing list is a good source to see the inner workings of algorithm peer reviews</li>
		<li>Call your congressman and talk to him about your "real feelings" about this information surveilance state</li>
	</ul>
